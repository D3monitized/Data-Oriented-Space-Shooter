First off: It was a while ago I worked on this assignment which is why I can't remember much about what I did. 

Why is this project more data oriented in it's programming? 


In the game there are a couple of 10'000's asteroids which makes the edge/border of the map. 
Rather than spawning all of these individually and then giving them their own MonoBehaviour scripts which will handle their logic,
these asteroids are spawned and controlled by systems which is a Unity Dots class. Basically these systems somehow more optimized spawn
in all the asteroids but then also handle all the asteroids logic in one single script which will be way more optimized than having 10'000
MonoBehaviours each handling their own logic. 

The rest of the game is handled in the exact same way which is all I can say really about it being more optimized and more data oriented
than doing it the "regular" way.
